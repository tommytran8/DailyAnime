Seasonal Anime's broadcast days

# Purpose 

Website that categorizes the current seasonal Anime by the day that they broadcast. This project was to help me learn about web-scraping, NodeJs, BootStrap5 for css, and noSQL databases with Heroku and MongoDB. In this project I webscraped from the website MyAnimeList to receive the data and stored the data on MongoDB.
